== Why jOVI? ==
Essentially for fun. I incidentally came across Nokia's map API, and since every time I've worked with map-based APIs it was always the omnipresent Google Maps API I decided I wanted to play with something different for once.

I wrote Javascript code for a few hours, had fun with Nokia's playground and I ended up with these considerations:

The user interface and user experience of the maps at Nokia is great
The API looks very complete, although I seem to understand they are continuously improving it
The API has A LOT of features, most of which will never be used by the average web developer
The documentation is kind of poor and not very user friendly
All these reasons led me to the idea of wrapping Nokia's API in a jQuery plugin that anybody can easily add to their website. I must say that what I am putting here today is version alpha 0.1, it doesn't have many features, I don't provide a minified version, but hey, you have to start from something right?

== Browser Support ==
Successfully tested with Chrome, Firefox 5 and Safari on Mac OS. Works well also with IE9 and Opera.

Works on Mobile Safari (iOS 4) and Android browser.

== Installing jOVI ==
Once you've downloaded the plugin you will have to add the following lines either ad the end of you page head or at the end of the body. I usually prefer to insert scripts in the body section for performance reasons.

<script type="text/javascript" src="http://api.maps.ovi.com/jsl.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.6.2/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="/path/to/jquery.jovi.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" >/*Your code here*/</script>
