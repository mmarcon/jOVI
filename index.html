		<h3>jOVI will be back online soon</h3>
		<p>
			Unfortunately more than <del>48 hours</del> 4 days ago the server that was hosting
			the homepage for the project went down. The tech support is unreachable
			and all the 400+ customers that have websites hosted on that server are
			angry.
		</p>
		<p>
			I hope the situation gets solved very soon, but in the meanwhile
			I decided to host the new jOVI homepage directly on Github, and I am
			working on getting back online the demos and examples.
		</p>
		<p>
			You can still download the code and see the tests as an example
			from <a href="https://github.com/mmarcon/jOVI" title="jOVI Git Repository">the repository</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			You can also support the angry customers by sending <a href="http://twitter.com/home?status=@Zyma_Hosting I want marcon.me/jovi back online!" title="Angry tweet">a tweet to the
			guys @Zyma_Hosting</a>. Hopefully at some point they will answer.
		</p>
		<p>
			I apologize for the inconvenience.

		<h3>Demos are back online</h3>
		<p>
		        I was able to put <a href="demo.html" title="jOVI Demos">the demo page</a> back online.
		        For now it is strictly a demo page with no documentation, I am still working on that.
		</p>
		<h3>First basic documentation is now available</h3>
		<p>
		        I finally have a first version of <a href="docs.html" title="jOVI Reference">the jOVI reference</a>.
		        Some stuff is still missing and the usability is not the best, but it still useful I believe.
