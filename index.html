		<h3 style="background-color:tomato">jOVI becomes jHERE</h3>
		<p>
		        jOVI has been completely rewritten and became <a href="http://jhere.net" title="jHERE home page">jHERE</a>.
		        jHERE has more feaures, is more reliable, extensible and well maintained. Please use jHERE
		        for your maps, as jOVI is no longer maintained.
		</p>
		<p>
		        You will be redirected to <a href="http://jhere.net" title="jHERE home page">jhere.net</a> in 5 seconds.
		</p>
		<h3>Demos are back online</h3>
		<p>
		        I was able to put <a href="demo.html" title="jOVI Demos">the demo page</a> back online.
		        For now it is strictly a demo page with no documentation, I am still working on that.
		</p>
		<h3>First basic documentation is now available</h3>
		<p>
		        I finally have a first version of <a href="docs.html" title="jOVI Reference">the jOVI reference</a>.
		        Some stuff is still missing and the usability is not the best, but it still useful I believe.
		</p>
		<h3>I am moving to Berlin</h3>
		<p>
		        Lately I haven't had the time to make improvements to the plugin. I am planning an international relocation,
				and that keeps me pretty busy. Plus I have to wrap up the last things at work, so I really don't have spare time.
		</p>
		<p>
		        But I will get back to jOVI as soon as I am sort of settled in Berlin. I'll keep you posted.
